Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon that allows individuals and organizations to access computing resources like servers, storage, databases, and networking over the internet instead of maintaining physical hardware. It offers services such as Amazon EC2 for running virtual servers, Amazon S3 for storing files and data, and Amazon RDS for managing databases. AWS is widely used for hosting websites, developing and deploying applications, storing and analyzing large amounts of data, running machine learning models, and enabling DevOps automation. Its key advantages include scalability, cost-effectiveness (pay-as-you-go model), high security, and global availability. Many major companies like Netflix and Airbnb rely on AWS to run their services efficiently and handle millions of users worldwide.
